# gametimeline
[A timeline of video games](https://andrewtoups.github.io/gametimeline/). WIP.

Based on the impressive list of video game settings compiled by the one and only [Alex Jaffe](http://twitter.com/alexjaffe).

Created by my older brother [Vincent Toups](http://github.com/VincentToups) in D3. Styling and UI by me.

Only games with canonically established real world dates are included. Try searching for "Metal Gear" for a good example.
